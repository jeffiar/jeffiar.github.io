          <h3>Who are you?</h3>
          <p>I'm a high school student growing up in the Bay Area.</p>
          <h3>What are your interests?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Computer science:</b> I do competitive algorithmic coding (USACO), and I'm fluent in C++, python, bash scripting, and R.</li>
            <li><b>Machine learning:</b> It's an invaluable skill as we enter the modern data-driven age. I'm all about the new hype about <a href="http://www.datarobot.com/blog/a-primer-on-deep-learning/">deep learning</a>, and I'm currently exploring its applications in biomedical informatics (specifically, microarray mRNA data). I'm also quite excited about how natural language processing will <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/courses/NAACL2013/">pick up on these techniques</a>.</li>
            <li><b>Linguistics:</b> Language is such a universal phenomenon, yet so commonly misunderstood. I've researched the sociolinguistcs of English phonological change local to my high school area, and I like to read <a href="http://specgram.com/">satirical journals</a> for fun.</li>
            <li><b>Music:</b> It's the deepest form of expression for the soul. I'm a classically trained french horn player and piano player, and I pour my angst and joy into the art. I'm also a big appreciator of hip hop and jass.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Where else do you exist online?</h3>
          <p>Check out my <a href="https://www.quora.com/Jeffrey-Chang-5">quora</a>, where I upvote good content but don't answer many questions. There's also my <a href="https://github.com/jeffiar">github</a>, where this webpage is hosted.</p>

          <h3>Why is your github username jeffiar?</h3>
          <p>Well, everywhere else online, it's jeffjar. But some fool took that github username already, so I had to choose something else. I'm kinda sad about that.</p>
